										<h5>So, I can I come by anytime for a tasting?</h5>
										
										<p>As the sole employee of this business, I am very busy during the day. I'm always completing tasks like finshing up an order, buying ingredients, writing a newsletter or working on my next seasonal flavours. So as much as I'd love for you to just hang out with me, you must book an appointment for tastings and dessert pick-ups.</p>
										<header>
										<h5>Do you have cake tastings?</h5>
										<p>Yes! When you come to one of our tastings/ consultations , you help me envision your cake. Feel free to bring any pictures, colors, and ideas you have. During the tasting you will be able to taste 3 flavours and 3 fillings of your choice. This is a great way for you to decide your favourite combinations! The consultation fee is $25. Keeping it at this price allows us to provide the best quality ingredients in the cake during and after your tasting. Sechdule your appointment by filling out the form below. </p>
										<header>
											<h5>How many people can come to a cake tasting?</h5>
										<p>Please come in a group of 3 maximum. Can't wait to meet you!</p>
										<header>
											<h5>I provided phtos and colors for my cake that I LOVE. Can you match it exactly?</h5>
										<p>I will try my absolute best to match your ideas. But there are occansionally hiccups in the making, like if a banner doesn't wrap all the way around and I have to remake it or a fondant strawberry doesn't exactly match the one in the picture. The same goes with colors. Cake dyes change in brightness and saturation once they dry/ are cooked and others might be are a combination of dyes. All cake artists have their different techniques, so please remain patient if the cake doesn't look exactly like the one in the photo. </p>
