								<h3>F.A.Q</h3>
								<h5>What are your office hours?</h5>
										<p>Monday through Thursday - 9:00 am to 6:00 pm. Fridday - 9:00 am to 3:00 pm. Saturday - 8:00 am to 2:00 pm delivery schedule permitting. I will be answering no emails, calls or orders on Sundays.</p>
										<h5>So, I can I come by anytime for a tasting?</h5>
										
										<p>As the sole employee of this business, I am very busy during the day. I'm always completing tasks like finshing up an order, buying ingredients, writing a newsletter or working on my next seasonal flavours. So as much as I'd love for you to just hang out with me, you must book an appointment for tastings and dessert pick-ups.</p>
										<header>
										<h5>Do you have cake tastings?</h5>
										<p>Yes! When you come to one of our tastings/ consultations , you help me envision your cake. Feel free to bring any pictures, colors, and ideas you have. During the tasting you will be able to taste 3 flavours and 3 fillings of your choice. This is a great way for you to decide your favourite combinations! The consultation fee is $25. Keeping it at this price allows us to provide the best quality ingredients in the cake during and after your tasting. Sechdule your appointment by filling out the form below. </p>
										<header>
											<h5>How many people can come to a cake tasting?</h5>
										<p>Please come in a group of 3 maximum. Can't wait to meet you!</p>
										<header>
											<h5>I provided phtos and colors for my cake that I LOVE. Can you match it exactly?</h5>
										<p>I will try my absolute best to match your ideas. But there are occansionally hiccups in the making, like if a banner doesn't wrap all the way around and I have to remake it or a fondant strawberry doesn't exactly match the one in the picture. The same goes with colors. Cake dyes change in brightness and saturation once they dry/ are cooked and others might be are a combination of dyes. All cake artists have their different techniques, so please remain patient if the cake doesn't look exactly like the one in the photo. </p>
										<header>
											<h5>How do I reserve my celebration cake/desserts?</h5>
										<p>Once you have an idea of what style your going for and/or you've come to one of my tastings, I'll will send you an email with a link to pay your non-refundable payment online. This payment assures that you will have a dessert the day of your party.</p>
										<header>
										<h5>Do you deliver?</h5>
										<p>I will deliver cakes that are 3 tiers or more. They will be created by me at home and assembled at your gathering the day of. Unfortunately I will not be offering cookie, cupcake and cake (less than 3 tiers) deliveries at this time.</p>
										<header>
										<h5>Will you be delivering my cake?</h5>
										<p>I will most likely be delivering your cake. If not, rest assured it will be a trained professional, who has experience in working with cakes. </p>
										<header>
										<h5>What kind of desserts do you make?</h5>
										<p>I make celebration cakes, wedding cakes, cookies, and cupcakes!</p>
										<header>
										<h5>Do you have an option for alternatives?</h5>
										<p>Yes! We want you to have the best experience during your celebration. Therefore we sell as many alternatives as possible for most of our desserts. These include vegan and non-lactose! Please keep in mind that I cook everthing in the same kitchen, so your food still has the possibility of coming in contact with  the following ingredients: WHEAT, EGGS, PEANUTS, TREE NUTS, FRUITS, and MILK.</p>
										<header>
										<h5>Do you offer alternatives for gluten-free customers?</h5>
										<p>We do not offer gluten free options. The only way to ensure no contamination is transmitted into our food, we would have to bake in a seperate kitchen with different pans, utensils and multiple layers of precautions. We do not have access to this at the moment, but we hope you can find another business who has what your looking for! </p>
										<header>
										<h5>What forms of payment do you accept?</h5>
										<p>I accept Credit Card, Venmo and Apple pay.</p>
										<header>
										<h5>What if I make a late payment?</h5>
										<p>I understand that we are all human and life happens. I would love for you to communicate with me prior to the payment, if you intend on paying it late, so that we can make sure the order is complete without any distractions! However, please understand there with be a $50 penalty for any uncommunicated late payments. Furthermore, there may be a complete cancel of order if the payment is more than a week late.</p>
										<header>
										<h5>Do you have a store front?</h5>
										<p>No, unfortunately we do not. Hopefully we will one day though! </p>
